## Design

### Wireframe

I used Balsamiq to create my wireframes. These low-fidelity wireframes were created to map out the user interface for the To-Do List application. The design prioritizes simplicity and ease of navigation.

### Home Page

![Home Page Wireframe](documentations/Home_new_wireframe.png)

The home page provides a welcoming message at the top, followed by a prominent area dedicated to showcasing the hero image, giving users an immediate visual context of the appâ€™s purpose. The navigation bar at the top ensures users can easily access essential links such as "Home," "Sign In," and "Register."

### Sign-In Page

![Sign-In Page Wireframe](documentations/Wireframe_signIn.png)

The sign-in page is straightforward, featuring fields for entering the username and password. The navigation bar remains accessible at the top for easy redirection to other sections, while the form is designed for quick access and ease of use.

### Register Page

![Register Page Wireframe](documentations/Register_wireframe.png)

The registration page includes fields for the username, email, and password, ensuring a seamless onboarding process for new users. The layout is clean, with a focus on usability, guiding users smoothly through the registration process.

### Agile Development

For the development of To-Do List app, I adopted an Agile methodology to ensure iterative and efficient progress throughout the project lifecycle. Central to this approach was the utilization of a Kanban board hosted on GitHub Projects. You can view the project board [here](https://github.com/users/Mah-N/projects/2/views/1)

#### Kanban Board Overview

I used GitHub project board to develop my site. The project board follows Agile methodology, providing a visual representation of the task management process. The board is updated regularly to reflect the current status of tasks, ensuring that the project progresses smoothly.

- **Todo**: This section contains tasks that are yet to be started.
- **In Progress**: Work in progress was tracked here, indicating tasks actively being worked on
- **Done**: Tasks that were completed successfully were moved to this column.

### Future Featues

**Task reminders and notification, Task filtering, Task catagorization**: These are features that are not essential for the current version but could be implemented in the future based on the project's needs or user feedback. They represent optional enhancements that may improve the user experience or add additional functionality.

**Task Sharing & Collaboration**: Certain features have been designated as "Won't Have" based on current project priorities and constraints. These features are not planned for development and will only be reconsidered if project goals and resources change significantly.

## Testing and Validation

### Responsiveness

I used the dev tools on chrome to test the website for responsiveness. I captured screenshots to demonstrate responsive design across mobile, tablet and laptop based on the size configurations preset in dev tools.

### Home Page

- Laptop

- Tablet

![Tablet view](documentations/Tablet_view.png)

- Mobile

- I used the [W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check the HTML on each of my site pages.

![HTML Validator](documentations/New_Validator_HTML.png)

- I used the [W3 CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check my CSS script by Direct Input. I found no errors! There are 4 warnigns which are just flagging vendor extensions.

  ![CSS Validator](documentations/CSS_Validator.png)

- I used the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to check all my python scripts. I found few errors like the below - mostly lines were too long or there was a missing blank space line. I have left some of the error messages as they are related to a too long line at the result of a comment.

## Chrome Browser Alert Issue

![Chrome_Issue](documentations/chrome_Error.png)

Please note that the deployed project link is currently being flagged as a dangerous site in Google Chrome. This appears to be a false positive triggered by Chrome's security policies, as the site functions perfectly in other browsers like Microsoft Edge, Firefox, etc.

If you encounter the warning shown in the screenshot below, you can safely bypass it by clicking on the highlighted area labeled "Only visit this unsafe site." This will allow you to access the project as intended.

This issue has been reported and should resolve itself in the coming days, as per advice from the tutor assistant. Please be assured that the site is safe and fully operational when accessed through other browsers.
